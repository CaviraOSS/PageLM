# What makes PageLM any better than LLMs like ChatGPT

PageLM is an open-source, AI-powered study platform that transforms materials (PDFs, notes, recordings) into structured learning tools such as SmartNotes, flashcards, quizzes, podcasts, and mock exams. Tailored for education, it differs from ChatGPT's general conversational AI by enabling file uploads, project organization, local or online model usage, and private server hosting. In essence, PageLM emphasizes learning automation and user control, while ChatGPT prioritizes broad conversation and reasoning.

## **PageLM vs ChatGPT — What’s the Difference?**

| Feature / Aspect               | **PageLM**                                                                                                                  | **ChatGPT**                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Goal**               | Designed for **education and study assistance**. Converts study materials into structured learning formats.                 | General-purpose conversational AI for any topic.                                                  |
| **Input Handling**             | Upload multiple files (PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT) and chat *specifically* about their contents.                                    | File uploads allowed (in Plus/Team), but not optimized for academic workflows or study structure. |
| **Output Types**               | SmartNotes, Flashcards, Quizzes, Podcasts, Exam simulations, Homework planner.                                              | Mostly text-based responses. You must manually prompt for each type of output.                    |
| **Persistence & Organization** | Maintains structured “Learning Projects” per topic. Files, notes, and generated content stay organized together.            | Conversations are separated and not inherently structured around study materials.                 |
| **Offline / Local AI**         | Can use local LLMs via **Ollama**, so it works even without the internet.                                                   | Fully cloud-based (requires OpenAI servers).                                                      |
| **Voice & Audio**              | Has built-in TTS (Text-to-Speech) to make **AI podcasts** and voice summaries.                                              | Voice available only in mobile apps and not as structured learning audio.                         |
| **Customizability**            | Fully open-source — you can host it, modify behavior, connect to your preferred AI model (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc.). | Closed-source, limited configuration.                                                             |
| **Privacy**                    | Self-hosted; your documents never leave your environment if using local LLM/TTS.                                            | Data processed on OpenAI’s servers.                                                               |
| **Licensing**                  | Free for personal and educational use (CaviraOSS Community License).                                                        | Proprietary subscription model.                                                                   |
